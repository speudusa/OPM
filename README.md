### Overview
When it comes to elementary school, reading is a large part of the curriculum. With my own children, I have found that making reading part of our day has helped with comprehension. I would love to say that this was an easy addition to our day, but reading time can easily be pushed aside for tasks that seem more important such as accompanying me to the grocery store, cleaning a bedroom, or even rushing through bedtime. Building this habit is just as much my job as theirs.

The purpose of this website is to create a record of reading that can be used within the family or shared with teachers. While a book API could easily be imported, at this stage I want as few distractions for my kids as possible. Book information is collected from user input. Reading information is collected via background date and timer collections. The information is then displayed in tables and a calendar. The reason a variety of data is being collected is to meet the various reading requirements of any teacher in any school year. In kindergarten, book titles were requested, in second grade times and page numbers were requested. This will collect both and be able to share data with a teacher.
